how to calculate training set accuracy
when is cross validation done
should model testing be done on a single test set or multiple test sets
should train and validation split be done before scaling or after scaling
should train and validation split be done before scaling or after scaling
should data be scaled before cross-validation or within k-fold cross-validation
