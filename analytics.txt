##### OVERVIEW #####

* types of data: numeric, image, text (structured, un-structured)

* types of ML algo: 
unsupervised (clustering, association rule mining/ market basket analysis, anomaly detection in univariate/ multivariate data) 
vs supervised (classification- binary/ multi-class, regression prediction)
reinforcement learning (https://www.quora.com/Is-reinforcement-learning-considered-a-branch-of-semi-supervised-learning)
recommender systems


* types of analysis:
level 1: descriptive  -> find trends & statistics, calculate metrics, threshold notifications, real-time observation
level 2: diagnostic   -> data mining & analysis, events diagnostics (both historical & real-time), feature importance selection,
                         root cause analysis,
level 3: predictive   -> modeling & planning
level 4: prescriptive -> advanced optimisation

## parallels between business use case & PhD research

# framing of high level use case
# formulating smaller questions/ sub-problem requirements to obtain solution to the high level use case
# check if data is already available; if not, run a POC / design & run your own experiments to gather data
# analyse the data - build models - do predictions


## parallels with crystallography
design experiment (cryst trials) to obtain crystals
gather crystallographic data
crystallographic statistics to assess data quality
model building - try to understand if any ML steps are involved
model validation
application of the model to gain some understanding; development of mutation experiments as further validation & application of the model
