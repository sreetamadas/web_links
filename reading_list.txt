types of error functions: MAE, MSE, MAPE

clustering through gradient descent, markov clustering, cosine similarity, entropy calculation,
distance correlation

dimensionality reduction through auto-encoder, PCA, SVD

feature importance through random forest  (how to handle class imbalance in RF?)

linear regression (Is linear regression valid only for normally distributed data points?)
logistic regression
support vector regression
SVM - gamma, cost, bias, variance

neuralNet (cNN - Theano, Lasagne), 
deep -learning,  (neural networks are ideally suited for detection & classification problems)
ReLu, Loss function;


association rule mining , 

time series analysis using FFT/ DFT , STFT ; 
(high-pass filter & FFT; high-pass filter removes low frequency component - similar to removing long-term trend )
shannon sampling theorem - creating bucket size
time serird pattern regression - autoregressive HMM
HMM
Nyquist frequency
kalman filter
butterWorth filter
spike-shift algorithm & curve-fitting


GAN
GLM, GAM
statistical process control , control charts


bayesian, 
matrix factorisation , auto-encoder ,
kNN,


linear sum assignment
