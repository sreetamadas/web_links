Lec 1: 
Use of pre-trained models (eg, VGG16) on new image data - faster, but this is affected by the biases in the previous data.
Always look at the data using which the model was built.

In deep learning, we dont look at either a single image or all images at a time. Generally we look at small groups of images,
called a batch or a mini-batch.


Lec 2:
Resources in wiki & slack.
Submitting results using kaggle CLI.
Save model weights.
Changing learning rate after a few steps.
Evaluation function: Accuracy, log loss.
5 steps to check how well the image recognition algorithm is working - see some egs of correct classification,
                                                  wrong classification, uncertainty in classification, etc.
As the no of epoch increases, network becomes more confident.
Main steps-
1. Create validation & sample set
2. Create sep directories
3. Finetune & train
4. Submit
5. Visualize


Sahana -> image classification vs segmentation.
