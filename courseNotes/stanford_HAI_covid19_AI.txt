Session III: Tracking the Epidemic

1. jason Wang 
Taiwanâ€™s Use of Data Analytics to Control COVID-19
JAMA paper - 124 action items to handle pandemics
(guidelines for tracking, settng up infra, command centre, 
checks on flights, 
linking customs data with travel history to medical data, 
analysis of medicalstocks, 
tracking ppl having come into contact with infected ppl using cellular data, etc)

2. Lucy Li (Chan Zuckerberg biohub):
Tools for Estimating Unreported Infections of COVID-19
- asymptomatic, less testing, 
- mutation in the virus as it transmits among individuals
- identify co-infecting pathogens

3. John Brownstein
Methods for Real Time Mapping of COVID-19 Cases Worldwide
- (see screen shots)

4. Epidemiological Forecasting Tools for COVID-19
Ryan Tibshirani
-CDC seasonal flu forecasting challenge

5. A Mobile App Intervention to Slow COVID-19 Using Crowdsourced Data
Tina White
- contact tracing with GPS data (data privacy & security issues) 
- bluetooth protocol for identifying contacts using local communication b/w phones (identifying info abt. ppl is not collected)

6. AI for COVID-19: An Online Virtual Care Approach
Xavier Amatriain
- personalized diagnostic assesment
- follow-ups of patients

7. Knowledge Technology to Accelerate Open Science in Addressing the COVID-19 Pandemic
Mark Musen,
-FAIR data, issue with metadata

8. What We Can Learn From Twitter Analysis About COVID-19
Johannes Eichstaedt
- draw inferences about mental health
- political, social, economic, information crisis


q/A
identify asymptomatic ppl
helping asymptomatic ppl through telehealth
predict cases based on symptoms
developing solutions for the elderly, who are less tech-savvy (use passive data from wearables instead of active data like reporting through apps)



Session IV: Treatments & Vaccines

1. Rapid Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Content Using the Functional Genomics Platform
Kristen Beck, bioinformatician, IBM
- virus mutating twice/month

2. COVID-19 Machine Learning Challenges
Anthony Goldbloom, Founder and CEO, Kaggle
i) NLP challenge- create an automatd Lit. review based on the frequently incoming articles
ii) forecast fatalities by city - variable importance plots
iii) dataset curating challenge - creating large merged datasets

3. Machine Learning Enabled Systems for Delivering Care to Critically Ill Patients 
Ron Li
- identify / predict patients who would require critical care
- validating/ enabling model workflows
- these would help to design response

4. AI-Assisted Elderly Care for Acute Infection and Chronic Disease
Fei-Fei Li
- high infection rate & fatality rate in elderly
- AI powered smart sensor technology for collecting data at homes
- thermal sensor, camera, wearables

5. Identifying COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates with ML
Binbin Chen,
- tools to find where pathogen binds

6. Repurposing Existing Drugs to Fight COVID-19
Stefano Rensi
- NLP - chemical -> disease -> gene links
- biophysical model : homology model the target protein + docking (calculate binding energy - box-plot of distribution of binding energy scores)
- 

Q/A
few shot learning
long tailed events
account for mutations when designing vaccine
check mutation profiles from samples of patients
apps to monitor PPE shortage
any benefits from BCG vaccine? may depend on where it is manufactured. inconclusive evidence as of now
